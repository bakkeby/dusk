# The below configuration file is parsed using the libconfig library.
#
# Refer to the official documentation if you need it. Here is a quick breakdown
# of the syntax used.
#
# A value can be set using an equals sign or a colon, the trailing semicolon is optional
# and whitespace is not significant.
#
#   name = value;
#   name: value;
#
# { settings ... }  - curly braces denote a group of settings, and a group can contain
#                     multiple types of configuration
# [ value, ... ]    - square brackets denote an array, and all values within the array
#                     must be of the same configuration type
# ( value, ... )    - parentheses denote a list, and a list can contain multiple groups,
#                     arrays, scalar values or other lists
# /* */, // and #   - treated as comments
# @included "path"  - include another configuration file - useful if you want to split
#                     the configuration into smaller parts
#
# When it comes to syntax highlighting for these kind of configuration files you may
# try Ruby, awk, cucumber, perl, puppet or R.
#


# Below we have some global configuration options, refer to
# the wiki page for more information.

# Note that in general if configuration options are omitted in this file then

  #    y
  #               0% - top bar (default)
  #             100% - bottom bar
  #               0y - exact position relative to the monitor
  #              -1y - value < 0 means use default
  #    w
  #             100% - bar takes up the full width of the screen (default)
  #              20% - small bar taking a fifth of the width of the screen
  #             500w - the bar is 500 pixels wide (including border)
  #              -1w - value <= 0 means use default
  #    h
  #             100% - bar takes up the full height of the screen
